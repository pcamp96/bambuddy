"""In-memory background dispatcher for slice jobs.

Slice jobs are independent (no printer-busy gating), short-lived (typically
5-60s), and the result is a `LibraryFile` or `PrintArchive` row rather than a
printer-side dispatch.

The frontend kicks off a slice via `POST /library/files/{id}/slice` or
`POST /archives/{id}/slice`, gets back `{job_id, status_url}`, then polls
`GET /slice-jobs/{id}` until status is `completed` or `failed`.
