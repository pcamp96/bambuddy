"""MJPEG fan-out broadcaster for camera streams.

Most Bambu Lab printers only allow one concurrent camera connection: the
RTSP socket on X1/H2/P2 models, the chamber-image socket on port 6000 on
A1/P1 models. Without fan-out, opening a second viewer either fails or
kicks the first viewer off — see issue #1089.

This module owns a single upstream connection per printer and pushes each
frame to N independent subscriber queues. New viewers tap the existing
upstream; no new printer connection is opened. When the last subscriber
leaves, the upstream is torn down after a short grace window so that a
quick page refresh or second-tab open does not pay a reconnect.
